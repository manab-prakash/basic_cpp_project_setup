# basic_cpp_project_setup
This is a basic setup to run cmake, googletest along with ccls, and cpplint in a VS Code ubuntu g++ environment. Please change the VS code settings (As current setup has modifications for my personal setup). Basic idea of this came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp1ifh9TuFI (which happens to be excellent cmake and googletest introduction). Cheers!!!
